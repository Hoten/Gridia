rethink crafting
  crafting, as is, is hard. need to memorize recipes. no fun! lets increase usability
  adding a time factor to crafting might be interesting, let's try that
  crafting things take time, ala Rust
  possible crafting recipes are shown in a crafting menu
  selecting a recipe will remove items from inventory, and create the product in x seconds
    if one of the resources is near the player (ON THE GROUND), then it stays there until completion
    if in inventory, it does not stay there (EDIT: wait why?)
  recipes can make use of items near the player (how to distinguish in menu?)
    axe (in inventory) + tree (near player) = chop down tree ... (this should show in craft menu, but have a more convienent option)
      TODO this sort of crafting recipe should slowly give the user resources (wood) over time. how to best integrate? (EDIT: should it? consider doing this on a second pass)
    plough (in inv) + ground (around player) = ploughed ground (which part of the ground? need to be able to select WHERE when multiple choices exist)
    hand (...) + closed door = opened door

    saw (in inv) + planks (on ground) = item made on ground
    saw (in inv) + planks (in inv) = item placed in inventory

    item crafting time...if item is meant to be placed in inv, and inv is full, crafting halts (at end) until there is room
    if item is meant to be ON THE GROUND, player must be near it for the crafting to continue on it.
    crafts on the ground take precedence over crafts for the inventory
    moving away from a craft on the ground PAUSES (doesn't reset) it's craft timer
    
    crafting menu only shows items that can be made w/ current resources (otherwise there are too many to show!)
      maybe show things in grey if you have the tool (but not the focus) on hand?
    item combos w/ multiple craft options produce submenus (hammer + planks = a lot of things, so the hammer+planks options is shown like:)
      ____________________________________________
      |      hammer and nails + wood planks    |  |
      |  [itemimg1] [itemimg2] [...] [itemimgn]|>>|
      |________________________________________|__|

      otherwise it's more like
      ____________________________________________
      |  knife + apple = cut apple, apple seeds   |
      | [tool] + [focus] = [prod1] [prod2] [...]  |
      |___________________________________________|

    crafts are queued. only one is active at a time. they can be canceled, this returns the resources to inventory

redo ui
  current ui is awful. let's get intimate with Unity's UI toolset
  this means NUKE THE UI I ROLLED MYSELF. what a waste
  ui while in 'game view' state should be CLEAN, unobstructed
    toolbar of important items on bottom of screen, ala Minecraft/rust
    quickly fading chat
    perhaps a small toolbar on the bottom for informational stuff (num players online, what else?)
  press TAB to bring up more menu stuff, ala Rust
